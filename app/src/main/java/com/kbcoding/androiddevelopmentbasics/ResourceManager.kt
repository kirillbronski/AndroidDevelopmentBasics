     * should call [ErrorHandler.onError] on [errorHandler] instance passed to
     * the constructor.

     * Each call of [consumeResource] gives an ability to receive the resource ONLY ONCE.

     * ```

     * prints "Hello, R1" 2 times:
     * ```
     *   val consumer: Consumer<String> = { resource ->
     *     println("Hello, $resource")
     *   }
     *   resourceManager.setResource("R1")
     *   resourceManager.consumeResource(consumer) // "Hello, R1"
     *   resourceManager.consumeResource(consumer) // "Hello, R1" again
